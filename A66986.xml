            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Worſhipful Sir <hi>THOMAS COOKES</hi> OF <hi>BENTLEY,</hi> Baronet.</head>
            <p>IF the following Sermon be not publiſhed in the very ſame words, in which it was Preach't before the <hi>Truſtees</hi> for your Charity at <hi>Fecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> it muſt be imputed to the ſhort warning I had to prepare for it; which giving me neither time to pen, nor commit to memory, what I then delivered, obliged me to thoſe ſudden, and almoſt extempore effuſions, which 'tis ſcarce poſſible ſo to recollect, as not to varie from ſome of the phraſes, and expreſſions then made uſe of: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as to the matter, and method it is intirely the ſame, and as ſuch humbly claims your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, none having ſo good a title to the ſubject, as your ſelf, whoſe Charity was the occaſion of it.</p>
            <p>On which account I could not but rejoyce, when I firſt choſe the Argument, that I had ſo eminent an Example before me, of what I was to diſcourſe: For, was I to ſpeak of <hi>doing good,</hi> and <hi>being rich in good works,</hi> and were not your <hi>Charitable ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements,</hi> as in the place, where the diſcourſe was
<pb facs="tcp:37034:3"/> made, ſo at <hi>Bromſgrave,</hi> and in the <hi>Pariſh</hi> where you live, with your large Bounty on other pious occaſions, a moſt proper comment on it? as what you farther deſign <hi>in Oxford,</hi> in the <hi>Colledge</hi> you are founding there, with the other growing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, which you have in the full purpoſe of your mind, were, of <hi>being ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate?</hi> and both, I hope, will end in the full demonſtration of what it is, <hi>to be laying up in store for your ſelf a good foundation againſt the time to come, that you may lay hold on eternal life:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only great pity is it in the mean time, that (to uſe the Apoſtle's words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11.) where there is ſuch <hi>a readineſs to Will,</hi> any thing ſhould <hi>abstruct the performance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoſe <hi>interest</hi> it is that <hi>ſuch works</hi> ſhould be obſtructed, is ſhewed in the <hi>24th,</hi> and <hi>26th</hi> pages of this Sermon; but even <hi>that it ſelf</hi> is one of the greateſt Arguments, why <hi>good men</hi> ſhould not be beaten off from their <hi>good purpoſes;</hi> and I truſt 'twill have that effect with you;</p>
            <p>For (not to mention your own honour, or that of your family;) the glory of God ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in ſuch eminent Charities, will be too ſtrong a motive, why you ſhould be <hi>ſtill preſſing on toward the mark, which is before you,</hi> and<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 14.</note> turning the deaf ear to thoſe, who <hi>would beguile you of your reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although neither can I imagin, why any one ſhould hope to be able to divert him from his
<pb facs="tcp:37034:3"/> good purpoſes, whoſe <hi>whole life, thoughts,</hi> and <hi>words</hi> are all <hi>Charity:</hi> I have ſaid it in the following Sermon, (p. 26.) <q>I truſt he, for whom I ſpeak, hath too well <hi>deviſed [liberal things]</hi> to repent of what he hath done; I truſt I can ſay for our honourable <hi>Benefactor</hi> in the words of the Pſalmiſt, my <hi>heart is fixed O God, my heart is fixed.</hi>
               </q> And I think I have as juſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for what I ſay, as can be had <hi>by any,</hi> but <hi>him alone,</hi> who <hi>knows the hearts of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſie-bodies in other men's matters, may create trouble, and uneaſineſs</hi> to him, ('tis what that worthy perſon, who preach't the laſt year on the ſame occaſion hath obſerv'd p. 8.) but will never be able, (ſuch is my <hi>confidence towards God for him,</hi>) to quench his Charity:</p>
            <p>If I may judge by his other actions, by the whole courſe of a ſerious, Religious life; if the deſires, and endeavours of keeping up good order, ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and moderation in a man's family, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being the example of it; if to profeſs piety in ones whole courſe of living, and labouring to infuſe it into them about him; if to appear with the greateſt devotion in all acts of divine worſhip; with that ſingular reverence to God in his own houſe, as to allow ones ſelf no other poſture, even in the time of Sermon, and reading the chapters, as well as prayers, but that of ſtanding or kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If to be zealous in encourageing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of others, to be troubled, and griev'd for
<pb facs="tcp:37034:4"/> thoſe, who abſent themſelves from the publick, neglect coming to the Holy Sacrament, or behave themſelves irreverently at either: If to profeſs, and practice the moſt univerſal Charity to all men, to be ready for every good work at preſent, (as I could inſtance in very liberal diſtributions made according to the rule of our Lord, <hi>of lending, hoping for nothing again;</hi> and nothing hath been receiv'd again, but the bleſſing of being <hi>reviled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 11.</note> and <hi>perſecuted</hi> for it: If not to <hi>give only a cup of</hi>

If to make <hi>Charity</hi> it ſelf the <hi>Legacy,</hi> he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bequeath his Heirs, at once quickening their zeal for this <hi>Grace,</hi> and leaving them wherewith to exerciſe it: If theſe are things, which will give a man confidence, in what he ſpeaks, (I ſpeak it not to flatter, but excite to a farther preſſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the mark, <hi>for the prize of the high calling</hi>

               <p>Let us ſee a little the reaſon of this in ſome of thoſe <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy circumſtances</hi> which attend the <hi>rich in this world:</hi> I ſhall name but <hi>three.</hi>

               <p>1. The <hi>baſe Flattery,</hi> the rich are ſo ſubject to from <hi>others: Baſe</hi> indeed! For nothing is ſo mean and unworthy of a man as to <hi>flatter</hi> another, or be <hi>flattered;</hi> and that generally, for what both the <hi>flatterer,</hi> and <hi>flattered</hi> ought to be ſo much aſhamed:</p>

               <p>Let the man in a fit of the <hi>Gout, Stone,</hi> or <hi>Cholick</hi> ſee, what eaſe all his bags will give him: the man under <hi>trouble,</hi> and <hi>anguiſh</hi> of mind try his <hi>ſoveraign gold,</hi> or whatever other may be the <hi>cares, afflictions,</hi> and <hi>diſcontents</hi> he may meet with in a froward world, let him ſee whether his <hi>heaps</hi> of wealth will <hi>furmount</hi> all:</p>
               <p>Or to go a little farther, doth the <hi>Devil</hi> buffet? doth thy <hi>own conſcience</hi> write bitter things againſt thee? nay, (as it may be) is <hi>thy ill gotten wealth</hi> it ſelf thy <hi>torment?</hi> and will the <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>tormentor</hi> be bought off with <hi>thoſe riches,</hi> which are the <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>inſtruments</hi> of <hi>both?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Foundation</hi> is the chief <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>ſupport</hi> of every <hi>building;</hi> the more firm and durable <hi>that</hi> is, the more firm, and durable will be, whatever is ſuperſtructed on it: This our Lord hath moſt aptly ſet out in his Parable of the <hi>wiſe man building his houſe upon a rock,</hi> and <hi>the rain deſcended, and the flouds</hi>

                  <hi>came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe:</hi> and it <hi>fell not, for it was founded on a rock:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>no rock</hi> ſo ſure, as <hi>that</hi> of Charity; the <hi>rains may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,</hi> the <hi>flouds come,</hi> the <hi>winds blow,</hi> and <hi>beat upon the houſe</hi> that is thus founded; (<hi>ſickneſs, afflictions, perſecutions, tryals, temptations, death, judgement</hi> are theſe <hi>rains,</hi> theſe <hi>flouds,</hi> theſe <hi>winds,</hi>) but it <hi>will</hi> not, <hi>cannot fall;</hi> It hath the <hi>word of God, which muſt ſtand for ever</hi> to uphold it: for ſo 'tis written (you heard it in one of the Chapters read this day <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters read were,</hi> Iſ. 32. <hi>for the firſt leſſon,</hi> Math. 25. <hi>for the ſecond.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Would we have this ſtill more expreſly? take it then, in that account, there is given of the manner of proceedings to be at the day of <hi>judgement,</hi> according as men ſhall have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37034:13"/> 
                  <hi>done good, been rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate;</hi> for ſo we read Math. 25. 34. 35, 36. <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand; come ye bleſſed of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and you gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me; I was ſick, and ye viſited me; I was in priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what now will encourage to the duty, if not the having whatever of Charity we do to others, accepted of Chriſt, as done to himſelf? what ſo <hi>crown all,</hi> as when by every <hi>the leaſt Alms</hi> we ſhall do for <hi>his ſake,</hi> we ſhall be intitled to <hi>his kingdom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides that it is <hi>written,</hi> (and they are the <hi>promiſes of him, with whom is no variableneſs, or ſhadow of turning;</hi>) ſo <hi>in reaſon</hi> it cannot be otherwiſe; For, can we, (if I may ſo ſpeak,) ingage <hi>the living God?</hi> (for 'tis to <hi>him we lend,</hi> what we <hi>give to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 19. 17.</note>

Heaven, and earth may paſs away; (theſe material ones will;) but he who governs both, will be always the ſame, and, as ſuch, ('tis a ſure foundation we build on, a ſure pledge, and earneſt of eternal life,) muſt give them, who truſt in him, a ſhare <hi>in glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But one thing more is there, I cannot but obſerve for the encouragement to this Duty, from the phraſe, in which the reward is here promis'd, viz. <hi>that they may lay hold of eternal life:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laying hold</hi> is, as 'twere the <hi>taking ſeiſm</hi> of what we reach after; the <hi>begining to</hi> enter on the poſſeſſion of what we hope for a more full eſtate in: Now that, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a future life, charity doth: It begins to enter within the veil, whilſt here; and anticipates eternity, by imploying it ſelf in that work, in which <hi>that</hi> ſhall be ſpent: ſo <hi>Heavenly,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:37034:13"/> ſo <hi>truly divine</hi> a thing is it to be <hi>doing good,</hi> to <hi>be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate,</hi> that he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſs his way to happineſs <hi>above,</hi> who hath ſo much of it, in what he doth <hi>below.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this be the <hi>good foundation,</hi> we muſt <hi>lay up in ſtore for our ſelves, againſt the time to come;</hi> If the <hi>hand of charity,</hi> be that, which muſt <hi>lay hold on eternal life;</hi> If it be <hi>an hand,</hi> which, as 'twere, reaches to it here, and even anticipates the poſſeſſion, in the <hi>works</hi> which fit us for it; If we may have ſo much of real <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>its happineſs</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> to it; When then muſt we begin <hi>to lay in this ſtore?</hi> When thus to lay <hi>hold on eternal life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this to me ſeems to be directed by the Holy Ghoſt, in the firſt words of the text: for if it be, <hi>charge them, that are rich <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And certainly it is ſo with reſpect <hi>to all charity,</hi> as 'tis the fulfilling of <hi>that Law,</hi> which always requires our conſtant Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and therefore no <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But 'tis not with reference to our <hi>ordinary charities,</hi> which are the whole life of every Chriſtian, that I put the Queſtion; <hi>Thoſe</hi> are not the occaſion of <hi>this days meeting,</hi> or <hi>diſcourſe;</hi> 'tis with reference to thoſe <hi>nobler,</hi> and <hi>more publick charities</hi> ſome men are more eminently called out to; ſuch as the <hi>building of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; building,</hi> and <hi>endowing Schools,</hi> or <hi>Colledges; building Churches</hi> and <hi>ſetling revenues for the ſervice of them;</hi> making large provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>for the poor of Corporations;</hi> for the <hi>improvement of Trades,</hi> and <hi>Manufactures,</hi> or whatever elſe may advance <hi>the civil,</hi> or <hi>Religious intereſt</hi> of mankind; 'tis with reference <hi>to theſe</hi> and ſuch like <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary charities;</hi> for which <hi>great, and extraordinary perſons</hi> are <hi>rais'd,</hi> and <hi>fitted</hi> by divine providence, I ſpeak this; that <hi>they</hi> would not, (what is too often done, and hath almoſt obtain'd ſo far, as if that were the propereſt time for men to be doing theſe great things for the world, when they are going out of it,) that they would not add this <hi>farther uncertainty</hi> to the <hi>riches of this world,</hi> to put off their

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>let us do good unto all men;</hi> and that for theſe ſeveral reaſons;</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe men muſt <hi>then do good, be rich in good works, be ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, when they are rich in this world:</hi> When death comes, every man is poor: The richeſt are then deveſted of their riches, and are themſelves to <hi>return naked into their Mother's Womb,</hi> as they came out of it:<note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> Then therefore cannot be the <hi>ſeaſon of charity,</hi> becauſe then <hi>they</hi> are no <hi>longer the rich,</hi> to whom <hi>the charge is</hi> given.</p>
               <p>2. Men muſt then give <hi>their Charities,</hi> when men have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>a Right,</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to what they give: when 'tis <hi>their own:</hi> which 'tis not, when <hi>God</hi> calls them from their wealth; when <hi>He</hi> who lent it, hath taken away <hi>the propriety,</hi> and given it to another: that other is <hi>my Child, my heir,</hi> whom God, and nature have transferred <hi>the Title</hi> to;</p>
               <p>Not but that in ſome caſes even ſuch may forfeit their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the <hi>Parent,</hi> or <hi>preſent proprietor</hi> is juſt in cutting off the <hi>entail;</hi> but generally ſpeaking, 'tis then <hi>theirs,</hi> to whom the inheritance devolves, not the <hi>expiring, uncharitable man's:</hi> for ſo it may be, if he who could not in all his life time find in his heart to do the leaſt good, ſhall think then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve a <hi>loſt ſtake</hi> by ſnatching it from another.</p>
               <p>Not that I would therefore damne <hi>all ſuch charities,</hi> which are <hi>then</hi> done; for if it be, what had been long purpoſed; what the <hi>good man</hi> had laid aſide, and devoted to <hi>ſuch uſes,</hi> and only wanted <hi>an opportunity</hi> to do it ſooner; If it be, what by his own <hi>diligence,</hi> and <hi>honeſt thrift</hi> he had been long ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering; and where, the Eſtate being intailed, he had no ways wrong'd it; the <hi>propriety,</hi> the <hi>diſpoſal,</hi> the <hi>charity</hi> is certainly <hi>his;</hi> and may be judged to be among thoſe <hi>ſtores ſo laid up againſt the time to come,</hi> that <hi>he may thereby lay hold on eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then in the former caſe, where all things are otherwiſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37034:14"/> ſettled; where the <hi>dying man's leaſe</hi> is expired, and the <hi>propriety</hi> eſcheats to the next ſucceſſor; where 'tis, (as it ſome times happens,) to cover <hi>thy malice, thy envy, thy injuſtice,</hi> will God thinkeſt thou accept of <hi>ſuch ſpoils</hi> for an <hi>holy Offering?</hi> will he give thee <hi>his ſtores above,</hi> for <hi>thoſe depredations,</hi> thou thus makeſt <hi>below?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No: it muſt <hi>be thine,</hi> when thou giveſt it; not what thou haſt been feeding <hi>thy luſt,</hi> or ſerving <hi>thy luxury</hi> with, whilſt thou could'ſt; and now thou can'ſt no longer cheriſh <hi>theſe,</hi> would'ſt turn thy <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> (what thou ſnatcheſt out of the hand of God himſelf; for 'tis he is the <hi>Lord paramount,</hi> the <hi>indefeaſible proprietor,</hi> to whom it reverts, and is again inveſted in; he, that hath recalled it, he that hath extinguiſh't the poſſeſſion, and transferred it to another:) would'ſt turn thy <hi>Sacriledge</hi> into <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>

               <p>For what is the <hi>enjoyment</hi> we have of any thing, but the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſatisfaction</hi> we receive from it? and can <hi>any comfort, any ſatisfaction</hi> be equal to that of having an <hi>all-ſufflcient</hi> God to fly to? <hi>Any thing</hi> ſo ſupport the <hi>Creature,</hi> as the ſenſe of his great <hi>Creator's</hi> grace, and favour being ſtill towards him? or any thing better prove <hi>his belief,</hi> that he hath <hi>a right</hi> to all this, than that he can ſo freely <hi>depoſit all with him?</hi>
